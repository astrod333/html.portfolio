<h3>Black Panther (2018)</h3>
<p>A groundbreaking Marvel film that transcends the typical superhero genre.
Director Ryan Coogler created a rich, vibrant vision of Wakanda that celebrates African culture while tackling complex themes of tradition versus progress, isolationism, and responsibility. Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of T'Challa is both regal and deeply human, while Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger stands as one of Marvel's most compelling antagonists.</p>

<h3>Captain America: Civil War (2016)</h3>
<p>The Russo brothers masterfully juggle a large ensemble cast while delivering an emotionally charged story about friendship, loyalty, and accountability. The film's core conflict between Captain America and Iron Man feels earned and genuine, avoiding the trap of forcing heroes to fight for contrived reasons. The airport battle scene is a comic book fan's dream come true, while still keeping the personal stakes high.</p>

<h3>Transformers (2007)</h3>
<p>Michael Bay's first entry in the franchise brings childhood toys to explosive life with groundbreaking visual effects. While the plot may be straightforward, the film succeeds in making the relationship between Sam Witwicky and Bumblebee feel genuine. The action sequences are spectacular, particularly the highway chase and final city battle. Though it prioritizes spectacle over story, it effectively established the franchise's high-octane style.</p>
